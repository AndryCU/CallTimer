# CallTimer
CallTimer is an app that allows the user to set their phone to go into Vibrate or Silent mode at a chosen period of hours. You can select for example from 7:00am-11:00am and the mode you want to go to in that period. Once that time arrives, the phone automatically switches to the selected mode.

Thinking that the user may have important contacts that he always wants to receive calls, a screen was created in which Exceptions can be added. When these exceptions call your phone it will start ringing.

In addition to this, a section was created in which the automatic sending of SMS can be configured to provide an automatically configurable response path.

The app is still under development so there are some bugs that need to be fixed and there are still more features to add.
